  <p>The Smart City project is a web-based software application built to store all the essential details of a city. Cities and urban areas witness a massive wave of people coming from every corner in search of jobs, education, and even a better lifestyle. In the initial days after the move, people don’t know the main facilities, attractions, and services offered in the city. The smart city project seeks to address that by creating an integrated platform to store essential and related information to guide the newcomers in a city.</p>
  <p>The application will provide visitors, students, and job seekers information like hotels, renting facilities, transportation services, healthcare services, airline ticket booking, shopping landmarks, emergency helpline, and basically every information that one needs when in a new city. It is like a smart city guide for visitors.</p>
  <p>Users can connect to the application via the Internet and browse all the smart city web pages to get the details they need. Users can see the entire map of a city along with the important landmarks. This will make their movement across the city much more comfortable. Mentioning java projects can help your resume look much more interesting than others.
</p>

<p>The smart city application has five modules:</p>

<p>Administration module – It is the central controller of the application. It uploads all the new 
information on the site and authenticates user profiles, and supervises the maintenance of 
the other four modules.</p>

<p>Tourism module – As the name suggests, this module handles all the tourism-related 
operations in the city, such as hotels, restaurants, tourist attractions, ATMs, theatres, and so 
on. A user authenticated by the administration module becomes the primary user of this 
module.</p>

<p>Student module – This module is designed specifically for helping students move around 
the city. It contains all the academia related information for students, including the location 
of best educational institutes, libraries, coaching centers, technical colleges, universities, 
colleges, etc.</p>

<p>Jobseekers module – This module contains important information on the job opportunities 
available in the city. Users can access all kinds of job-related information across various 
industries. The main objective of this module is to help the city administration to combat 
unemployment problems in the city.</p>
